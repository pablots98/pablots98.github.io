                <h1>Pablo Tejero</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Pablo Tejero</strong>, a biologist passionate about understanding complex biological systems through computational approaches. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Biology, followed by a Master's in teaching high school biology. However, my curiosity for the intersection of biology and technology led me to Maastricht, where I completed a two-year Master's in Systems Biology.</p>
                <p>During this time, I deepened my expertise in bioinformatics, network biology, computational biology, and modeling. My 7-month internship focused on metabolic context-specific models, where I evaluated thresholding algorithms and identified core reactions in senescent fibroblasts. This experience further strengthened my drive to work at the crossroads of biology and data.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am working as a <strong>Research Associate at KU Leuven</strong>, where my research focuses on developing <strong>intracellular computational models of chondrocytes</strong> to investigate the mechanisms underlying <strong>osteoarthritis</strong>. This work allows me to combine my background in systems biology and computational modeling to address clinically relevant questions in musculoskeletal research.</p>
                <p>Beyond research, I have contributed to academic life as a student ambassador and tutor, experiences that helped me refine my communication and mentoring skills. I believe that sharing science—whether with students, colleagues, or the public—is as important as advancing it.</p>
                <p>I’m proficient in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>MATLAB</strong>, tools I use daily to explore biological complexity. Looking ahead, I am particularly excited about the role of computational biology in advancing <strong>personalized medicine</strong>, and I aim to contribute by developing models and tools that bridge molecular mechanisms with translational applications.</p>
                <p>Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss potential collaborations, research opportunities, or any projects where biology meets data!</p>
