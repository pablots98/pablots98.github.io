                <h1>Pablo Tejero</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Pablo Tejero</strong>, a biologist with a passion for understanding complex biological systems through computational approaches. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Biology, followed by a Master's in teaching high school biology. However, my curiosity for the intersection of biology and technology led me to Maastricht, where I completed a two-year Master's in Systems Biology.</p>
                <p>During this time, I dove deep into bioinformatics, network biology, computational biology, and modeling. My 7-month internship allowed me to explore metabolic context-specific models, where I evaluated thresholding algorithms and identified core reactions for senescent fibroblasts. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that solidified my love for working at the crossroads of biology and data.</p>
                <p>Alongside my studies, I had the opportunity to contribute to Maastricht University as a student ambassador, helping prospective students, and as a social media ambassador, sharing insights into student life. I also took on the role of a tutor for a Bachelor's course, a position that allowed me to further develop my communication and mentoring skills.</p>
                <p>I’m proficient in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>MATLAB</strong>, which I use to tackle complex biological problems. Looking ahead, I am excited about the possibilities in personalized medicine, particularly where computational biology and bioinformatics can make a significant impact. I aim to contribute to this field by developing models and tools that help tailor medical treatments to individual patients.</p>
                <p>Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss potential collaborations, research opportunities, or any projects where biology meets data!</p>
